	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It provides a way to quantify the efficient of an algorithm by expressing how the execution time grows as the input size increases in known as Time complexity.
</p>

	<p>
		Consider an array with N elements. The <b>Space Complexity</b> in this case is O(n), as the memory required scales linearly with the number of elements in the array. .
