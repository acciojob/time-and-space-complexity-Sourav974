	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It provides a way to quantify the efficient of an algorithm by expressing how the execution time grows as the input size increases in known as Time complexity.
</p>

	<p>
		The amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It accounts for the total amount of space required by the algorithm, including the space used by variables, data structures, and function call stacks.Consider an array with N elements. The <b>Space Complexity</b> in this case is O(N), as the memory required scales linearly with the number of elements in the array. .
